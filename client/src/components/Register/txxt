// Here's a high-level example of how the login page flow could work:

// The user navigates to the login page and enters their credentials.

// React sends the user's credentials to the backend.

// The backend uses the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to verify the user's identity by querying the blockchain network for the user's registration data.

// If the user's identity is verified, the backend generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) and sends it back to React.

// React stores the JWT and uses it to authenticate the user's subsequent requests to the backend.

// If the user's identity is not verified, the backend returns an error message to React, and the user is prompted to try again.

// Note that this is just one possible way to implement a login page for a Self Sovereign Identity solution using React and Hyperledger Blockchain.
// The specific implementation details will depend on your project's requirements and architecture.
